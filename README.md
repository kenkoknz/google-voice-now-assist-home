    Google Assistant: The voice-based Google Assistant that was previously only available on the Google Pixel and Pixel XL, but is now rolling out to all phones with Marshmallow and Nougat.
    
    Google Home's Assistant: Another voice-based variant of the Google Assistant, which is only available if you purchase a Google Home smart speaker.
    
    Google Allo's Assistant: A text-based form of the Google Assistant that you can access by installing the Google Allo app for Android or iOS.
    
    Google app: What used to be called Google Now and Now on Tap. Instead, these features are now called Feed and Screen Search, respectively, and they're both included with the regular Google app for Android or iOS. The Google app's Feed shows you cards with relevant info before you perform a search, and the Screen Search feature lets you perform a quick Google search for keywords on the screen you're viewing (Android only).

Google now: on google search

Google Now is Google's voice-activated personal assistant -- similar to Apple's Siri or Microsoft's Cortana. Unlike Siri and Cortana, Google Now isn't platform-specific; the app works on both Android and iOS devices, though its hardware-controlling capabilities are limited on iOS. The app lets you quickly search the web and perform a variety of tasks -- such as scheduling events and alarms, adjusting your device's volume and posting to social media

Google Assistant is basically the next generation of Google Now -- it does most of the same things, plus more, and it has a friendlier, more conversational interface. The preview edition of Google Assistant debuted in the Google Allo chat app and Google Assistant will also be found in the Google Home and integrated into the Google Pixel phone. Google Assistant performs all the same tasks as Google Now: web searching, scheduling events and alarms, adjusting the hardware settings on your device and pulling up information from your Google accounts.

Google Home devices

Google Home is the company's direct competitor to the Amazon Echo and launched in the US in November 2016, since then, it's been made more widely available. It launched in the UK in spring 2017, with a British accent. Google Home is essentially a Chromecast enabled-speaker that serves as a voice-controlled assistant.

It's the first port of call for Google Assistant in the home and likely to be the first device that people think of. There's an expanding ecosystem however, with three devices currently available from Google themselves.

    Google Home vs Google Home Mini vs Google Home Max

You can ask it to do anything you'd ask Assistant to do on Android phones, but moving into the home really put that emphasis on other services and functions, like smart home control, compatibility with Chromecast to send movies to your TV and a whole lot more.

Following the launch of the Amazon Echo Dot, Google unveiled the Home Mini in October 2017. The Mini can do everything the regular sized Home can do, but in a much smaller package. It can be connected to other speakers and hi-fi systems to play through them, too.

The Home Max is much larger than the Home and Google's answer to the Apple HomePod. It's designed with music playback in mind and so features two 4.5-inch woofers alongside two 0.7-inch tweeters. Ultimately, it offers all the functionality, but delivers a much bigger sound.
